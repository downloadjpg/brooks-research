## Hi! 
This is to filter horse statistics from a PDF format into a spreadsheet using some simple Python code.

We are only sampling from horses with 3 or more starts.

## From each PDF we need:
- the name of the foal
- how many starts they had
- the year they were born
- sex
- dam (mother) name
- dam sire (if possible)
- totals (how many win place and shows)
- career length (in years?)
